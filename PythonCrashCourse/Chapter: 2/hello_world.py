# COMMENTS
# In python we write comments by add ing a # tag at the beginning of the file,
# and all other words after the # tag are treated as a comment so they do not
# be displayed to our users. comments can be single line or multiple line comment
# Python has only one method to create comments whether it is single or multline comments

# Introduction to variables.
# variables are containers to store user data. Every variable is connected to a value
# Which is the information associated with that variable.
# For Instance.

message = "Hello World"
print(message)

# At line 12 "message" Is a variable, "Hello world" is a value of the variable
# Adding a variable makes a little more work for the Python interpreter.
# When it process the first line, it associate the variable with the "Hello World" text.
# When it reaches the second line it prints the value associated with the massage to the screen

# You may add more lines of code as you can. For example
message = "Hello 3 months python challage"
print(message)

# It will result into two lines of code output.
# At any time you can change the name and value of your variable
