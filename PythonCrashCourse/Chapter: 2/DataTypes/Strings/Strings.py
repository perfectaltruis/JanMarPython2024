# String is a series of characters
# In python anything inside the quotation is considered a string
# For Example:
#    "this is a string"
#   'This is also a string'

# From the above, we can say that in python we have the ability to use
# quotes and apostrophes within our strings

# SIMPLE EXAMPLE:
print('I told my friend, "Python is my favorite language!"')
print("The language 'Python' is named after Monty Python, not the snake.")
